            <h2>Utah State University</h2>
            <p class="font"> My whole life I knew I wanted to be a teacher. In
                May of 2017 I finally accomplished that dream. I graduated with my Bachelors in Early Childhood
                Education. Before
                graduation I had already accepted a teaching position at Mountainville Academy in Alpine, Utah. It was
                my dream job teaching kindergarten at a fantastic charter school in a great community.

            <h2>Teaching</h2>
            <p class="font"> My first year teaching was definitely full of ups and downs. Teaching in not an easy
                profession especially that first year. By my second year I already felt so much improvement. During that
                year I gave birth to my second son. I finished the school year, but
                decided to shift to being a preschool teacher in order to lessen my hours allowing me to be home more.

            <h2>Transition to Tech</h2>
            <p class="font">Teaching was my passion, but my kids will always be my everything. In order to be
                the mom I wanted to be I left teaching. I knew I wanted to continue working, but I needed a different
                career. IXN was my bridge into the tech industry. January of 2020 I started working as a data manager.
                This position grew over the next two years and confirmed tech is where I wanted to be.

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p class="font"> After a little over a year at IXN we were acquired by Insurance Technologies. I
                continued to learn and grow at this company for another year before leaving in March of 2022. At this
                time I became a full time mom due to a lack of childcare options. Over the last
                year I have expanded my knowledge, and plan on working towards becoming a front end software developer.
