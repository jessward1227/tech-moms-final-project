            <h2>Jessica Marie Ward - Me</h2>
            <p class="font">Hi, I'm Jessica! Here you will find a few of my favorite things. If you'd
                like to know more about how I got to where I am today feel free to check out My Story page. I love
                playing pickleball. I enjoy getting the exercise
                and being able to compete in a sport as an adult. During the summer I love paddle boarding, hiking, and
                enjoying the midnight sun. I don't love cooking, but sure enjoy eating delicious foods. My favorite
                color is blue, sea turtles are my favorite animal, and I love the mountains. </p>

            <h2>My Family - Brax, Jay, Stockton</h2>
            <p class="font">My family is my everything, and how could they not be! I am a proud momma to two little
                boys, with a third on the way. Being a boy mom is full of messes, owies, bugs, and dirt, but I wouldn't
                trade it for anything. What truly makes parenting special is having my best friend by my side through it
                all. Braxton is there through every up and down, and always keeps me smiling. I sure do love my little
                crew. </p>

            <h2>Alaska - My Home</h2>
            <p class="font">The Last Frontier, Land of the Midnight Sun, The 49th State, all names of the beautiful
                place I get to call home. I love living in Alaska for so many reasons. It is a great place to raise
                kids, and beauty is around every corner. I love how the people here embrace every season regarless of
                temperature or weather. We go outside all year round! There are always adventures to be had, and the
                state is so big we will never run out of places to explore. Alaska is home.</p>
